# coroutine v0.1 #

This project aims to implement coroutines in C++ just for fun of it :)

For now there is only a implementation for iOS arm7 (and armv7s ?) with omission of VFP registers. Works with both LLVM GCC 4.2 and Apple LLVM compiler 4.1.

Additional 'asm' directives allow for placing breakpoints in Xcode.

Tested on iPhone 4 with iOS 6.0.
